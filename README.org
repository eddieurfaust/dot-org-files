#+TITLE: My dot-org-files

*** Source
    I got this great idea and template from [[https://github.com/ivoarch/.dot-org-files][ivoarch@github]].

*** Usage
    Run =C-c C-v C-t= or =C-c C-v t= or the command =org-babel-tangle=
    to create the files specified in the SRC-blocks.

    Remember to make backups of those files, since I didn't get any
    warnings when a file was overwritten.
